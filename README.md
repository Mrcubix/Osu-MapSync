# Osu-MapSync
A tool that will allow the sync of you BM, scores, replays and collection from a pc to another using different methods

This should be working as of now, until a new osu! update change the formats

Todo list:

- Add more sync methods
- Cleanup

# Usage:

just open Sync.py > type Help or help or ? at the first prompt for available commands
